## Workshop description
Do you need a stats refresher and some extra practice with R? This workshop is for you! Join us for a solid 2-hour hands-on review of the fundamentals, including confidence intervals, hypothesis testing, interpreting p-values, simple linear regression, and more. Weâ€™ll get down to business on how to perform basic statistical analyses using R and how to interpret the results with minimal math and theory. The goals are to help you develop (or rediscover) some intuition for basic statistics, get comfortable using R for statistical analyses, and grow your arsenal of strategies and tactics for working with data in R.

R is available to everyone. The only prior knowledge assumed for this workshop is basic experience using R such as how to open an R script, read in and manipulate data, and submit R code. Be sure to bring a laptop in order to participate.
